Project explanation.

  
Using IRS ZIpCode returns data we thought we can use it to predict migration patterns. 
  Migration patterns means which states are gaining people, which are loosing people.
  This migration might show details on the states loosing for example currently people are moving
  out of North Dakota after shale gas slump
  
  So if there is an API to select AGI and state and who how the state performed in return for that AGI in that state
  the tool would be useful for further analysis.

Data Collection 
  We used IRS Returns/Zipcode data. We collected 3 years of data to show either slump of boom in returns filed.

Cleaning And Modelling data
  The template for IRS Returns/Zipcode data changed every year in the last three years. So the data collected
  had to be cleaned properly.
  The we created a new template which can be used for all the three years data and changed the pandas dataframes
  to this new template. 
Data Representation 
  We tried to use Bokeh library to represent data. We faced some issues with the complexities and decided upon
  using ipywidgets.
How to Use 
  After completing the run of final cell a widget would appear as shown in the screenshot

  You can select zipcode/State or AGI and it shows how the trend of returns in the last 3 years
