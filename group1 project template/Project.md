Using twitter to see the trends on usage of programming languages.

=============

# OVERVIEW 
In our day to day life we see machine learning and analaysis of open data set useful to the developers across the world to build a tool to explore some useful information . We would like to use data from our twitter which contain rich data source which can pull information about any topic which we would like to invesigate.Data from twitter can be used in different ways to research different trends like brands revalution of a products,fetching reviews about newly launched products and thier services.
Using twitter would like to see the trends on usage of programming languages and using twitter data we try to rank programming languages like Java, ruby, javascript, scala and python. 



# DATA

We would like to fetch data from twitter streaming API by downloading tweets related to keywords like ruby,java , python etc.
As a next step we need to access the 4 modules of information from twiiter as API key , API secret , Access token and Access token secret .
We will be using the Python library "tweepy" to connect to Twitter Streaming API and download the data .



# RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Intial methodology
would like to explore the trending programming languanges which are more popular amoung the global devlopers and help new technology seeking aspirants to learn and enhance thier career.


# MODELS AND ANALYSIS

The models are described and the preliminary analyses will be performed in a Jupyter Notebook and development in python and soon we will post them in our Github repo under analysis.



# CODE AND APPLICATION
 
Will post the code in our github repository and instructions on installation are in the README.md file at the root level soon.



We are team of three , Kishore kumar Sunkoju ,Rahul Monthe and Deepthi Chenagoni we will be sharing our work amoung ourselves .
Kishore will be taking care of development ,data analaysis ,back end work consisted of an API that was created to provide data to the front end.  deepthi and rahul would work on data set, data analaysis and together we are collaborating to check the progress of the project testing.
