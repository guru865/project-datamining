Clustering your LinkedIn professional network based upon the locations of your connections and emitting KML output for visualization with Google Earth.

=============

# OVERVIEW
In our day to dy life we see machine learning and analaysis of open data set useful to the developers across the world to build a tool to explore some useful information . We would like to use data from our linkedin connections cluster them using kmeans clustering and visualizing the output on Google Earth. The job network we build is one of the most crucial aspect in our career. How wide and varied it is puts us in an important position. We are planning to build a tool which when given the credentials of your linked in account, takes them clusters your connections into groups and displays them on google earth to show how are your connections grouped and where are they from.

# DATA

LinkedIn API Access

LinkedIn implements OAuth 2.0 as one of its standard authentication mechanisms, but still supports OAuth 1.0a, which provides you with four credentials ("API Key", "Secret Key", "OAuth User Token", and "OAuth User Secret") that can be used to gain instant API access with no further fuss or redirections. we can create an app and retrieve these four credentials through the "Developer" section from the account settings by navigating directly to https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer.


Note that we need to install a third-party package called python-linkedin to use the code in this notebook. Installing a package directly from a GitHub repository is easy with pip in the terminal as follwed 


pip install python-linkedin.


# RESEARCH QUESTIONS
intial methodology
we are planning to build a tool which when given the credentials of your linked in account, takes them clusters your connections into groups and displays them on google earth to show how are your connections grouped and where are they from.


# MODELS AND ANALYSIS

The models are described and the preliminary analyses will be performed in a Jupyter Notebook and development in python and soon we will post them in our Github repo under analysis.



# CODE AND APPLICATION
 
Will post the code in our github repository and instructions on installation are in the README.md file at the root level soon.



we are team of three , Kishore kumar Sunkoju ,Rahul Monthe and Deepthi Chenagoni we will be sharing our work amoung ourselves .
Kishore will be taking care of development ,data analaysis ,  Back end work consisted of an API that was created to provide data to the front end. and Writing O Auth script to pull linked in Connections and deepthi and rahul would work on data set, data analaysis and UI development and together we are collaborating to check the progress of the project testing.
You will need to provide details on:
